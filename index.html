<!--we will need the instructions on the page:
Guess what word I'm thinking of!
wins
losses
guesses left
your guesses so far

the game will need to record the keystrokes of the user- document.onkeyup(event)
it will need to apply math for computer to pick a random word from an array math.floor(math.random)
it will need to compare whether or not the letter picked is within the words (.charAt for loop)

user gets 10 guesses
if the user guesses a letter in the word the computer generates, it will show the letter in the word field
if the user guesses an incorrect letter, it will decrease the guesses left column by 1 ( i--) 
all keystrokes are recorded next to guesses so far
after 10 guesses, the losses counter will increase by 1. The game will reset (new word from the bank)!-->
